            <p>Costa Rica spends almost one third of its budget on education. But this isn't a rich country--the US makes 22 trillion dollars in gross national income each year, while Costa Rica only makes 97 billion.</p>

            <p class="quote">How can it afford to spend so much on education?</p>
        
            <p>This country has stressed the importance of quality education since its constitution in 1869. That's when they established mandatory primary education for all children, and it would be paid for by the government.</p>
        
            <p>In 1949, right after a civil war, Costa Rica decided it would rewrite their constiution. They did keep the universal education established earlier, but they changed other things. One relevant decision was the abolition of the army, and the reinvestment of all of its funding into education.</p>
        
            <p>This allocation of resources is very progressive compared to other Central American countries, where the ratio of military spending to humanitarian services is no less than 1:4, while Costa Rica's is 1:20.</p>

            <h2>How is Costa Rica so progressive?</h2>

            <div>
                <p>Simply put, Costa Rica was not attractive to foreign conquerors. Even though the name means "Rich Coast", the settles soon found out that the gold was traded into the country--they had no valuable metal of their own.</p>
    
                <p>Though the country was made a Spanish colony, the Europeans did not set up a controlling government in the region. The Costa Rican government was free to nurture its democracy. In 1821, after Mexico gained independence, Costa Rica declared the same, and without needing local combat.</p>
            
                <p>Soon, institutions in the country were also secularised, and around this time came the birth of Costa Rica's universal education.</p>
    
                <p>The country's progressive agenda not only nurtures the minds of its schoolchildren, but also contributes to less infant mortality, less malnutrition, and reduced impact of economic recessions. The country's Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, is lower than others in the region.</p>
