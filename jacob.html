        Government spending on education in Costa Rica is relatively high compared to most other countries, and today, the Costa Rican education system has grown to over 4,000 schools. However, tecent studies show that only about 35% of the Costa Rican population between 18 and 24 years old attend higher education, compared to over 60% in the United States. Adititonally, one-third of that population goes to a public university. And in spite of the generous government spending, the GDP per capita of Costa Rica (USD PPP) is 15,594 compared to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) average 40,589. The OECD is comprised of 37 countries including Canada, Chile, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Spain, UK, and the United States. However, school enrollment is not only an issue in advanced levels of education. The percentage of 25-34 year-olds who have attained tertiary education is 28% compared to the OECD average of 42%

        While Costa Rica struggles to compete globally, the country actually outperforms its Central American counterparts. The graph above (2006) reveals that Costa Rica has about 73% of their G3 students performing at level two or above, while only one of its neighboring countries managed a score higher than just 40%. Additionally, less than 4% of the population older than 15 years old doesnâ€™t know who to read and write, meaning the country is declared free of illiteracy by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Science and Cultural Organization).
