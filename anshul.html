        <p> To improve education in Costa Rica, it's important to consider the purpose of education. What are the benefits to educating the population? While there may be many factors to consider, such as the overall happyness of the students during school, in this page, we will mainly focus on the effects education has on the productivity of society. In other words, we hope to improve the quality of education to have a more productive society, which will allow for greater consumption of resources, an improved economy, and a higher standard of living. </p>
        <p> In this way, educating students is like an investments. We pour money into educating students and hope they can return a greater amount of money back. </p>

        <p> With improved productivity as our goal, it's important to consider what content we teach students. It's best to teach students the most relevant information that will lead to the greatest productivity when they grow up. The most relevant content to teach students in Costa Rica could possibly differ from the most relavant content to teach students in the U.S or any other country, since Costa Rica has a unique job market.  </p>
        <p> To address this issue, we could have specialized curriculum developers. Their job would consist of choosing the content and curriculum to teach sutdents in school. </p>

        <p> In order to improve the quality of education, it's useful to consider the various factors that affect education. </p>
        <p> For instance, the quality of education for each student depends on the quality of their teachers and the quality/quantity of resources provided (such as notebooks, pencils, textbooks, notes, online resources). </p>



        <p> There may be other factors that affect the level of education, but these two factors, teaching and resources seem the most relevant. <p>

        <p> It's important to note that in recent years, Costa Rica has put a significant amount of effort into improving education. For instance, they've raised the prerequisites to becoming a teacher and now 95% of teachers have a tertiary education degree. They have formallized a system for recruiting teacher, reducing the risk of hiring teachers by politicisation and unfair appointments. But the system isn't perfect yet. According to an assessment, 40% of English teachers and 29% of Mathematics teachers do not have mastery over the content they are expected to teach. </p>
        <p> To combat this problem, we could improve the initial selection and training process for teachers. The selection process should be as accurate as possible, by assessing the most important skills for teachers. We could lower the selection criteria to recruit more teachers. Or, we could higher the slection criteria to improve the standard of teaching. The initial training process should ideally be used to cover any gaps in knowledge and cover various pedagogical tools. </p>

        <p> Additionally, it would be useful to provide more incentives to becoming a teacher. Inlcuding more financial and career support for teachers could incentivize people to become teachers and incentivize teachers to improve their teaching. Additionally, we could more accurately reward teachers as feedback when they accomplish teaching goals. </p>
        <p> Another important problem to consider is that there are few teachers in schools. Among primary schools, 65% have less than five staff members and half of primary schools have only one teacher. In this context, it would be useful if there were professional development days where teacher could congregate and discuss their strategies for teaching. </p>

        <p> In summary, to improve the quality of teaching, we could: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> have more financial and career incentives for teachers </li>
            <li> have a more accurate system for rewarding and appreciacting teachers </li>
            <li> have more proffesional development days</li>
        </ul>

        <p> In addition to improving teaching, it would be useful to improves the resources students use to learn. These resources could range from notebooks, to textbooks, to notes, to online resouces, and to chromebooks. We could have special curriculum designers discussed before also look for high quality low cost resources for students to own. But, it's difficult to pay for more resources without more funding. </p>

        <p> In fact, funding seems to be important to improve both teaching and resources. Money is needed to create more financial and career support, and money is important to pay for school supplies. However, Costa Rica already spends the most, by percentage, of any country in education. It may be difficult to improve funding, but it may be possible to increase the percentage of educational spending that goes into paying for resources and giving teachers financial support. </p?
